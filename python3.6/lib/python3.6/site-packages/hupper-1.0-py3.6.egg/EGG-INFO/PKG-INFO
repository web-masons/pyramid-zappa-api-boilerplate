        ``hupper`` is an integrated process monitor that will track changes to
        any imported Python files in ``sys.modules`` as well as custom paths. When
        files are changed the process is restarted.
        
        Command-line Usage
        ==================
        
        Hupper can load any Python code similar to ``python -m <module>`` by using the
        ``hupper -m <module>`` program.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ hupper -m myapp
           Starting monitor for PID 23982.
        
        API Usage
        =========
        
        Start by defining an entry point for your process. This must be an importable
        path in string format. For example, ``myapp.scripts.serve.main``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # myapp/scripts/serve.py
        
            import sys
            import hupper
            import waitress
        
            def wsgi_app(environ, start_response):
                start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain'])
                yield [b'hello']
        
            def main(args=sys.argv[1:]):
                if '--reload' in args:
                    # start_reloader will only return in a monitored subprocess
                    reloader = hupper.start_reloader('myapp.scripts.serve.main')
        
                    # monitor an extra file
                    reloader.watch_files(['foo.ini'])
        
                waitress.serve(wsgi_app)

        ===============
        
        ``hupper`` is inspired by initial work done by Carl J Meyer and David Glick
        during a Pycon sprint and is built to be a more robust and generic version of
        Ian Bicking's excellent PasteScript ``paste serve --reload`` and Pyramid's
        ``pserve --reload``.
        
        
        1.0 (2017-05-18)
        ================
        
        - Copy ``sys.path`` to the worker process and ensure ``hupper`` is on the
          ``PYTHONPATH`` so that the subprocess can import it to start the worker.
          This fixes an issue with how ``zc.buildout`` injects dependencies into a
          process which is done entirely by ``sys.path`` manipulation.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/pull/27
        
        0.5 (2017-05-10)
        ================
        
        - On non-windows systems ensure an exec occurs so that the worker does not
          share the same process space as the reloader causing certain code that
          is imported in both to not ever be reloaded. Under the hood this was a
          significant rewrite to use subprocess instead of multiprocessing.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/pull/23
        
        0.4.4 (2017-03-10)
        ==================
        
        - Fix some versions of Windows which were failing to duplicate stdin to
          the subprocess and crashing.
          https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/pull/16
        
        0.4.3 (2017-03-07)
        ==================
        
        - Fix pdb and other readline-based programs to operate properly.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/pull/15
        
        0.4.2 (2017-01-24)
        ==================
        
        - Pause briefly after receiving a SIGINT to allow the worker to kill itself.
          If it does not die then it is terminated.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/issues/11
        
        - Python 3.6 compatibility.
        
        0.4.1 (2017-01-03)
        ==================
        
        - Handle errors that may occur when using watchdog to observe non-existent
          folders.
        
        0.4.0 (2017-01-02)
        ==================
        
        - Support running any Python module via ``hupper -m <module>``. This is
          equivalent to ``python -m`` except will fully reload the process when files
          change. See https://github.com/Pylons/hupper/pull/8
        
        0.3.6 (2016-12-18)
        ==================
        
        - Read the traceback for unknown files prior to crashing. If an import
          crashes due to a module-scope exception the file that caused the crash would
          not be tracked but this should help.
        
        0.3.5 (2016-12-17)
        ==================
        
        - Attempt to send imported paths to the monitor process before crashing to
          avoid cases where the master is waiting for changes in files that it never
          started monitoring.
        
        0.3.4 (2016-11-21)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for globbing using the stdlib ``glob`` module. On Python 3.5+
          this allows recursive globs using ``**``. Prior to this, the globbing is
          more limited.
        
        0.3.3 (2016-11-19)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a runtime failure on Windows 32-bit systems.
        
        0.3.2 (2016-11-15)
        ==================
        
        - Support triggering reloads via SIGHUP when hupper detected a crash and is
          waiting for a file to change.
        
        - Setup the reloader proxy prior to importing the worker's module. This
          should allow some work to be done at module-scope instead of in the
          callable.
        
        0.3.1 (2016-11-06)
        ==================
        
        - Fix package long description on PyPI.
        
        - Ensure that the stdin file handle is inheritable incase the "spawn" variant
          of multiprocessing is enabled.
        
        0.3 (2016-11-06)
        ================
        
        - Disable bytecode compiling of files imported by the worker process. This
          should not be necessary when developing and it was causing the process to
          restart twice on Windows due to how it handles pyc timestamps.
        
        - Fix hupper's support for forwarding stdin to the worker processes on
          Python < 3.5 on Windows.
        
        - Fix some possible file descriptor leakage.
        
        - Simplify the ``hupper.interfaces.IFileMonitor`` interface by internalizing
          some of the hupper-specific integrations. They can now focus on just
          looking for changes.
        
        - Add the ``hupper.interfaces.IFileMonitorFactory`` interface to improve
          the documentation for the ``callback`` argument required by
          ``hupper.interfaces.IFileMonitor``.
        
        0.2 (2016-10-26)
        ================
        
        - Windows support!
        
        - Added support for `watchdog <https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/>`_ if it's
          installed to do inotify-style file monitoring. This is an optional dependency
          and ``hupper`` will fallback to using polling if it's not available.
        
        0.1 (2016-10-21)
        ================
        
        - Initial release.
