## Read First
Overall, we support three types of issue request. We may add more in the future. We have templates for each issue
request contained within this template.
- Bug Report
- Improvement Request
- Request for Assistance

Please use the section that makes the most sense, and delete the rest. Each section begins with a Flag and an H1
level title. Please leave the title so that it's easy for us to categorize it.
